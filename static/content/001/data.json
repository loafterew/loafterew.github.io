A lady I work with went through my notebook, saw the picture of the stingray plus the word turtle. She called HR because she thought I was writing notes about her in my notebook. She said that horribly drawn stingray plus the word turtle meant that I want to punch her in the face because she is slow like a turtle. Definitely a reach. I didn't get in trouble, I was just told by my boss that I'm not aloud to talk about turtles anymore in case it upsets her. I rarely talk about turtles, so this isn't really a problem for me.\n****Edit: I'm still relatively new to reddit, so I'm not sure if this is an acceptable way to do this, but I am just going to edit the original post to answer everybody's burning question: He was not eating stingray/turtle tacos at work. He was telling me that was his favorite type of tacos to eat when he was at home. He is originally from Mexico and is in Iowa on a TN visa. Maybe in his coastal Mexican town it is normal to eat stingrays and turtles. I have no idea, really.

So our Payroll team sent over the Court Order and session dates it all took place in. I asked our Solicitors to look it up and see what went down, since it was all a matter of Public record.\nEnds up our Employee never bothered going to the Court to contest the Order and just ignored it.\nSo armed with this knowledge I brought him in and laid it all out.\nInitally he listened and just sat and waited for me to finish. Then after I'm done and explain nothing further can be done nor can we amend the payments. He explodes at me, personally blaming me for all his problems and that he can't afford these payments.\nFinally after listening to him shout at me for 10 minutes and blaming me for his problems. I dropped my professional demour and flat out told him. That if he bothered to defend himself in court as much as he fruitlessly was trying to do here. Maybe he wouldn't be in this position.\nAt that point he threatened to kill me, but shouted it loud enough that HR outside the meeting room heard it. My HR manager came in and just told him to leave and was fired on gross misconduct. At which point he tried to swing a punch at my HR Manager (who was an Amateur boxer). He knocked the guy out, put him in the recovery position and called 999 for an Ambulance and Police to attend our work.\nIt was a most eventful HR meeting I ever had."], ["notyetcomitteds2", 65, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esyij3a/", "Small business so I'm everything and for the most part, the HR stuff is, I reported you to labor and this is why.\nDumbest one ever was for not paying overtime.  He worked 35 hours for me, and 20 hours somewhere else...not my business.  He felt he was entitled to 15 hours of overtime pay.  I had to spend a day with labor showing them 3 years of time sheets.\nSecond dumbest, I had an employee repeatedly making a serious mistake, but it was so simple.  You could really only make it by being negligent.  Anyways, I went with I trained him poorly, so for a few weeks, everytime he made a mistake, I pointed it out and showed him how it should have been done.  Always one on one.  I wont even pull someone aside if anyone else is around.  He reported me for bullying.  Everytime I pointed out his mistake, \" it made him feel less of himself.\"  Labor didnt bother with that one, I started writing him up and he quit 2 weeks later."]]]
