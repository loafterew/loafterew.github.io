Since I was the closest asshole to the maitre\u2019d I was tasked with performing this duty.\nAfter stalking the table for a solid hour the moment was inevitably approaching. I set up at an angle she couldn\u2019t see me and when he busted out the ring I started taking as many pictures as I could. Anyone who has tried to capture a once in a lifetime moment on camera knows that you\u2019re not really watching what\u2019s going on, you\u2019re just trying to frame the moment. After about 20-30 pictures I slowly realized that she was declining the proposal and the scene was quickly degenerating into a Five Alarm dumpster fire. However I was far enough away that I couldn\u2019t hear what was being said and couldn\u2019t be sure of what was transpiring so I continued taking pictures just in case. Finally I stepped back and watched the scene unfold in reality as she stormed out of the restaurant in embarrassment and he scrambled to pay the bill and chase after her.\nHe\u2019d requested that I use my phone and send the best pictures to him. Needless to say he never approached us for the pictures and I have about 100+ pictures of a wedding proposal gone wrong somewhere deep in my iCloud photo bank..."], ["TheRelevantElephants", 129, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g4a8g7/waiters_what_dating_disasters_have_you_witnessed/fnw9xs0/", "I used to bartend at a yard house in the beforetimes\nYard house is a corporate place that's basically a nicer sports bar with a ton of beer on tap with stupid, giant novelty glasses.

At some point he scraped some pineapple glaze off his dessert and onto her spoon when she popped outside to make a call. She comes back and eats without noticing too much, has a severe reaction.

It's not that big, but we're usually full during week-ends. A lot of couple come here cause it's kinda \"chic\"  for a french restaurant.\nAnyway, once there was a couple,  early 30s. The dude arrived earlier than the girl, so i though it was something like a date but eeh no... The girl ordered everything, she chose all the dishes, the dessert and even the wine without even asking the guy what he would like to have. They both didn't talk, only said good evenning, weird for a date. But when i came at their table to server the wine, they started to argue about their relationship. The dude was convinced that she cheated on him, and you know what, she admitted that and said very loud that he was bad in bed... at this moment any single cell in my body was cringing They kept arguing for 10 minutes until i decided to stop them, coz they were almost yelling and so disturbing the ~15 people in the restaurant. The woman asked if she could have an other bottle of wine, and she left within 5 minutes WITH THE BOTTLE.
