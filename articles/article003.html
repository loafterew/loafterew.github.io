									Getting yourself out in the dating scene can be hard, and first dates are particularly challenging! Getting to know someone intimately for the first time can mean a lot of awkwardness; and a lot of romantic tension. However, that doesn't mean that all first dates have to go poorly! Here, people share the best first dates they've ever had.

								<p>I was meeting a guy for dinner and a hookup. We ate at a pizza place and just fucking Clicked, and I don't think I've ever felt so excited to be eating with someone. We walked back to my apartment but it started pouring rain and we were freezing and soaked by the time we got back. I let him use my shower and borrow some dry clothes. By the time we were clean and dry, we were too tired for sex and I said he could stay the night so he didn't have to go back out into the rain. We went to bed but ended up lying awake and talking until 5:00 in the morning. It has been about two years now and we are very happy together. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d81vz0n/">Esosorum</a>

								<p>I met her at a mall a week and a half after we met.  We had been talking a ton via text message the last week and a half, but she had been out of town so we couldn't meet up.  She was all smiles the whole time.  We didn't even do anything, we just sat talking for a few hours in a less populated corner of the mall.  (One of the largest malls in America.)  I kissed her and she almost died from happiness... I'm not even joking, she couldn't contain herself, it was so adorable.
She is now my fiancèe.  I proposed at the same spot. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d81s4k9/">Ghukek</a>

								<p>Drove 30 minutes to the mall, she watched me eat shitty Chinese food because she wasn't hungry (bought her a soda which I then drank half of), then we went to Dicks, found a hammock on display and cuddled for two hours while I talked shit about her friends, drove her back to her parents' house, they invited me inside, they talked to me for an hour about my plans for the future (and showed me baby pictures), then we went upstairs and watched tv, kept a foot of space between us for fear her dad would walk in, she walked me out, went for the kiss, realized her dad could see, panicked and settled on a side hug. Left her standing on her lawn looking puzzled and slightly disappointed.

								<p>I invited her over to my place in the afternoon. I made us some food and we spent about 8 hours just talking and getting to know eachother. Then we laid outside in the hammock together and stared at the stars and made pictures out of the clouds. I drove her home late that night and we had our first kiss at her front door.
Kinda cliche but it was absolutely perfect. Instant chemistry, got to know each other, cuddled in a hammock under a starry summer night sky, and ended with our first kiss -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d81v7lq/">whitestormee</a>

								<p>Met up with a guy from tinder after moving to a new city. Went for a couple of drinks before heading to a movie - turns out I got the time wrong and we'd missed it, making me look like a prat. Went to a few more bars until my card got declined and he had to buy the drinks, which again made me look like a prat.
I suggested that I could repay him with a drink back at my flat... The rest of the night is a bit blurry but we're still together two years later so it must've been a good one! -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d81vbci/">CloudOrigami</a>

								<p>Technically can't be considered our first date because there was the time before this that we hung out one on one, and the time after this was the first time we were actually dating. But it's a cute story and that's all people on this thread want, I know that's why I'm reading it. So. Guy best friend, younger than me, I've just graduated high school. We know we like each other but we're keeping it just friends because we don't think it will work out with me leaving for college. But it's a weird friends with mild benefits thing, we hold hands and cuddle. I go over to his house and we walk around the park by his house. We go to his favorite spot and he says "I always thought I would bring my girlfriend here when I was older." I was a little freaked out like dude I'm not your girlfriend, but I didn't say it. After that we go back to his house and we hang out in the media room, both of us in one recliner, not watching TV or anything, just chilling and cuddling. He says "is it bad that I wanna kiss you?" and I, in my brilliance and trying to be logical, say "yeah probably." So then of course we both sit there panicking, and I'm kicking myself for refusing a kiss from the guy I've liked for months. I start saying its okay, and he said thank and I was like "no it's okay to kiss me." the rest of the afternoon was comprised of a good deal of making out. We've been dating for a more than a year now. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d81xbd4/">lilwac</a>

								<p>My first date with my college girlfriend of five years was great. We went kayaking on a bunch of connected lakes, and we somehow got lost. We were stuck in this small town with barely any places to eat, so we bought whiskey and marshmallows to roast in the woods. I remember wading in this small stream when she pulled me in and kissed me. We slept in our double kayak and the next morning, the lake patrol (or something like that) brought us back to campus. There was a second date equally as adventurous as that. Even after we broke up, she's still my friend. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d823dl3/">killowen_12</a>

								<p>Knocked it out of the park with someone that I'm still friends with. We went on one date to just sort of see if it could happen, but both decided we weren't compatible.
Was the kitchen manager at a restaraunt.
Surprised the girl by taking her to my restaraunt after close. Had set up some Christmas lights, put flowers and candles on the tables, hooked good music up to the intercom system, and cooked her a killer pasta dish.
She had never been on a real first date. All her boyfriends had sort of been friends that moved into the significant other circle so they never felt the need to do anything other than the movie and dinner classic. So she was really surprised and impressed.
Until she got married, she used that date as the high bar. I'm friends with her husband, even he says she still brings it up. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d8263oi/">djs9pd</a>

								<p>This first date ended up lasting about 72 hours... He was house sitting for his parents and tried to have a bunch of people out to hang. I was the only one that could go. We'd only ever hung out in groups but had been sorta flirty. I went anyway.
We went on a hike, cooked dinner, watched football, drank two bottles of wine... Great date vibe! Then decided the hot tub sounded nice. Didn't have my suit, so opted to get in naked. Still hadn't kissed or anything...
2am comes around and my stupid drunk adventurous self insisted on getting in the treehouse. It had two levels and I climbed up to the tallest part. We finally kiss in the treehouse. Yay giddy! It's cold and late and I tried to climb down with a headlamp....... Missed a step. Fell off the edge, about 8-9 feet. Hit the ground, rolled down a hill (through poison ivy. Naked). I was freaking out - convinced I couldn't feel my fingers and toes. He jumps out of the treehouse, makes sure I'm not paralyzed, helps me get back to the house. Head is bleeding, back is spasming.
Call 911. End up in the ER with two fractured vertebrae and 8 staples in my head. I plead with him to not feel like he has to stay (even though I totally wanted him to). He does.
Spent 3 days in the hospital... He brought me pizza and books and company. Helped me get home and brought me food and binge watched shitty Netflix since I was immobile for like two weeks.
Been together 3 years next week :) -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d829ayn/">Treehouse_throwaway</a>

								<p>I have two that were really good. The first, in 1988, I invited a guy I'd just met to come to my place and just hang out. It was a date, we just hung out and talked, but we talked about everything and we talked all night. Listened to Dark Side Of The Moon (that album always makes me think of him). It's been a long time, so I don't remember much more than that, but we really clicked that night.
The other was in 1994, with a guy who was my best friend's boyfriend's roommate. We were instantly massively attracted to each other. The energy between us was enough to fill a room. A whole group of us went to an after hours club playing some amazing electronica, and at one point, I couldn't believe it, but they played Beethoven's 9th symphony, the second movement. Absolutely my favorite classical music song. Nobody knew this, so it's not like someone requested it for me. But we were all drinking, of course, and he took me out onto the dance floor and we danced and danced, old-fashioned style. He totally swept me off my feet, literally and figuratively. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d824p35/">pixelmeow</a>

								<p>My boyfriend and I met on Tinder back in college, and after a few hours of messaging back and forth decided we should hang out. It was fall break but we were still on campus and both very bored. I drove over to his apartment with two Cookout milkshakes (NC represent) and we sat on his couch and talked from midnight to 9 am. He didn't even try to kiss me or anything--we sat on opposite sides of the couch and hung out all night. Texted for a few weeks, hung out around Halloween and started dating the next week. Been together ever since, and I think it's because our first date was hardly that. I've never felt so immediately comfortable around anyone else, and doubt I ever will. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d827ba4/">anerdinthehand</a>

								<p>Not really a date more of a first encounter. I went back to a friends house after a night out (same student accommodation) and met this girl, we talked for a bit across the room, I was shuffling cards as people were leaving the room to go to bed or smoke and she got up, I assumed she was leaving. Instead she came over and asked if I wanted to play a game of cards. I said sure, another guy waltz into the room and starts cooking noodles as she teaches me a card game.
So it's basically me and her playing cards at 4 am in someone else's house (she was a neighbour) and one of the guys who lives there sitting beside us eating noodles out of a pot. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d822fwm/">seanf999</a>

								<p>It was kind of a surprise date. She knew that I bowled in a league on Thursday nights. As league started I got a text from her that she was stopping by with a friend. We all had a few drinks while I showed off on the lanes. Afterwards she told me her friend was staying over with her that night so I thought it ended there. Right when I got home she sent a text saying her friend decided to go home. She then invited me over. She opened the door to her apartment wearing a bathrobe. After she locked the door behind me she walked down the hall to her bedroom and dropped the bathrobe. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d8270d2/">crunch816</a>

								<p>I knew this girl for several years, we were friends in college while both seeing other people (or one of us was, or... etc.  The timing was just always off).  Was always interested, but we were good friends and that worked.
Anyway, fast forward several years, talked or saw each other on occasion but not frequently, she asks me if I want to meet up on St Patrick's day and hang out for the evening.  Long term friends at that point, and I'd met her boyfriend several times, so thought nothing of it - Her boyfriend traveled for work sometimes, or maybe he'd meet up with us later.
Turned out they'd parted ways some time prior (it'd been probably 6 months since we talked), it was definitely her nervously asking me out, and once I got the hint - it didn't take all that long - we had a great night.  Listened to a bunch of music, drank probably slightly too much, went home, watched a movie, slept (separately, still a slightly awkward "long-time friends or maybe...." type thing), and spent the entire next day hanging out and catching up, and basically confirming that  this was a really good idea.
We got engaged a few months ago, will be getting married next year. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d828p6v/">SchrodingersPheasant</a>

								<p>I had recently broken up with a long term boyfriend and this guy I liked knew I was bummed that I no longer had plans for the 4th of July, so he asked me out, and we were going to go after work and watch the fireworks. This was back when most people had cell phones, but we weren't crazy attached to them.... back when it would have been weird to have a charger with you. We were both supposed to get off work at 4 go home shower, change, get ready, and he would pick me up at 5:30. So I was at work, and my phone died. Then someone called off, and I had to stay late. I didn't even get off of work until a little past 5. I rushed home and ask my parents if he had come over to get me because at this point it was a little past 5:30. They said no one had come by for me. I was so bummed because now I was not only late for my date but it also looked like he was standing me up. I showered and got ready anyway, just in case. Then at 6:30 he came to my house begging my forgiveness, and the Forgiveness of my parents. His phone died while he was at work, and someone called off. He had to stay late. He didn't even get home to take a shower and get ready until a little past 5:30,... Just like me. Neither of us knew the other was going through the exact same situation. we both thought we were getting stood up for being too late or whatever. He made sure to apologize to my parents because he thought coming over an hour late seemed disrespectful. Then we drove out to the place where we were going to watch the fireworks, and just as we got there it ended. So he drove to the nearest fireworks stand and bought the rest of the crappy fireworks they had left. He drove out to a secluded Country Road laid down a blanket, and shot off all those fireworks for me. It was so sweet. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82c437/">shinyrox</a>

								<p>Honestly I didn't really realize this was our first real date but it was the start of our relationship. I was 17, kind of all over the place and I met this super sweet/shy guy who was my coworker at my first job. He picked me up from work (he was off) and we went out and got chipotle. I refused to eat in front of him (which I got over pretty quickly) so I got chips. He kept offering me food but I kept declining. After, we went to Toys r us where we wandered around for hours looking at toys and reminisced about the toys we had when we were kids. He helped me pick toys out for my nephew and niece. We ended up sitting in his car afterward and talked until the whole parking lot cleared out. I felt like I could talk to him forever. We clicked so quickly and I just wanted to be around him all the time. He's so amazing. Two and a half years later and he's still mine! -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d8254l1/">stephmichss</a>

								<p>I'd been talking to a girl online for a while after meeting at a gig and really clicking. We finally decided to meet so I thought I'd take her for a drive in the countryside. I picked her up and we were both really awkward and nervous. On the drive we laughed about stupid things and listened to music until we got to a nice country pub for lunch. We ate, talked more, and decided to go for a walk around the hills. Unfortunately it started raining about 30 minutes into the walk so we huddled up under a tree and talked for two hours until the rain stopped. We walked back and drove back to my place where we got really high and watched Rambo. She stayed at my place for 5 days before going home and we've barely spent a day apart for over a year since then. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82f35g/">lj523</a>

								<p>It was October. Right before Halloween. We were meeting at a coffee shop that was open pretty late. I got there first as I have a habit of getting places early when I am nervous. I ordered my own tea and sat outside. It was chilly and it was getting dark and the coffee shop had some cute fairy lights. He was late because his frat meeting went late. He got hot chocolate and we talked for hours.
The coffee shop closed and we still sat outside. Eventually he had to pee so we walked to the closest building on campus that was open. We crushed leaves and talked about cartoons the whole way there. We took a long walk back to our cars and ended the night with a hug.
Four years later and that was the first night of a lifetime with my lobster. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82an2s/">Toulouse-Caboose</a>

								<p>We met after matching on Tinder. Our first date was at a small, restaurant in her town (we live in the Netherlands). I remember that I arrived there early and waited at a table inside. I recognised her chaining her bicycle up across the street and fell in love immediately. I stood up when she entered and we just hit it off from there: the conversation flowed and we actually comfortably discussed the three faux-pas of the dating ritual:
Afterwards, we walked together and she showed me the town. I walked her back to her bicycle and we kissed. I'd never met a girl like her before and we're still together 5 months later (I know, not very long). -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82f8cv/">Chicken_Burp</a>

We were laying on the floor tickling each other and he finally got the courage to kiss me. It was an awesome day. Even though he had to leave partway through The Return Of The King to help his sister with her math homework. I didn't find out until a week later that we were dating, because he assumed that because we kissed that we were in a relationship lol. We got married about 7 months later.

								<p>Ok, so I worked at a restaurant in college and became good friends with a guy there who had a lot of high school friends also going to school there. So I meet a bunch of his friends, one of them a cute girl. Id never had a conversation with her, we were just aquaintences. Then the next year she and I both joined the marching band. I would see her at practice and say hi but that was about it. Then came time for our school to play University of Florida. It was mentioned to me by a mutual friend that she didnt know who she was sitting with on the bus ride so I asked her if she wanted to sit together and she agreed. We got on the bus around 11pm for an eight hour bus ride. Most people tried to get some sleep but she and I stayed up the entire trip talking and getting to know each other. We covered so many topics and found that we had a lot in common. Then the next day since we were in Florida the band went to Disneyworld. On the way there I let her know I had a hit of acid and asked her if she wanted to split it which she did. So technically our first date (even though we didnt know it) was tripping at Disneyworld together. The whole day was just so surreal in a good way. So many awesome things happened that day. We marched in the parade. We tried to eat but both of us thought our food was gross (because the acid was kicking in), but then we traded food and were able to eat what each other had ordered. There was a moment where we were in the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse, and were talking about how we much we loved it and that we should move in there together. We had an awkward pause where we both realized what we were saying. Then on the bus ride home I realized that I was completely head-over-heels in love with her. That was twenty years ago, we have been together for half of our lives now. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d829lpb/">Rednaxel6</a>

								<p>My boyfriend and I actually met accidentally on chat roulette in 2012... he was from NJ and I'm from NY. He was cute and was just sitting there and we just started talking. It became very flirty instantly.
We spent 9 months getting to know each other online before actually meeting in person, the day he finally came to NY to see me, I anxiously waited at Penn station for him. He approached me and we hugged. I'm a bit awkward and was shy the whole time, when he gets anxious, he's more talkative, so we balanced each other out. We went to a bar on the lower east side, then walked through Tompkins square park, he kissed me there for the first time.
A quick peck on the lips just came at me by surprise, it was the cutest thing ever how shy he was about it, but then he grabbed my hand and we talked as we walked back to union square, where we sat on a bench and he kissed me some more while I showed him my itchy mosquito bites (we'd been talking for 9 months, so we knew little details about each other, like how itchy I'd been all summer from these bites).
We got on the train and headed back to queens where I live and we slept together that night also.
The next morning he came with me to a psychiatrist appointment that I couldn't reschedule.
We have been together for 4 years now and have lived together for 2 years :) -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82cqn4/">ayananna</a>

We talked quite a bit during those months and when I returned we finally set up a date. I met him at his place in the morning, dropped off my car, and he drove us to the airport.
He was a helicopter instructor and we flew out over some islands while he was teaching me to fly. We landed in a small town on one of the islands for lunch, took off, did some aerial whale watching, landed, and headed back to his place.
Upon arrival, he had a second surprise. During our months of texting while I was gone, I had mentioned that my first car was my absolute favorite and how much I missed driving it (little red MG Midget convertible). I shit you not, he had tracked down an identical car and borrowed it for us to rally around in for the rest of the day.  All this was followed by dinner at my favorite local restaurant and a bonfire and champagne on the beach.
I wish I could say we lived happily ever after but both of us were moving out of the country within the month.  We'll occasionally check in with each other online, but that's it. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82bedq/">mycogirl</a>

								<p>This guy I met on Tinder, believe it or not, told me to meet him at this, eh, over priced frat bar. I had just moved to this new city, and I was very bored..so I decided to go. I kind of eye rolled when I walked in thinking, I've been here before...why did I come...this place sucks... He walks in, is an absolute gentleman, picks me up from my seat and walks me straight to the back of the bar and through this weird hallway to a wall. This girl is just standing there. He says, 'we have a reservation.' She smiles and lets us through the wall (!!!) into this absolutely amazing speakeasy with all copper everything. I was training to be a bartender at the time, and I was/am super into mixology, and he knew that.. I just thought it was very sweet gesture..also very pricey for a first date ($100+tip...I peeked). We both realized we didn't really feel the sparks-therefore didn't have another date, but as far as first dates go, that was definitely one for the books. It felt good to feel special and worth the effort. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82a3vh/">weedybleach</a>

								<p>There was a woman I knew as a friend of a friend from my local watering hole. She wasn't a regular, but we always had great conversations and a good time when she did show up. I has asked her out on several occasions over the course of about a year and she finally said yes.
I took her to the Palm; we both had lobster. Then it was drinks at the Signature Lounge (on the 96th floor of the Hancock Center in Chicago). Then it was back to my place for a nightcap. Then it was her calling her ex-husband asking if he could watch their kid until tomorrow (it was fine with him). Then it was sweet, sweet love.
I wasn't really trying to set up a perfect date or anything, we were just both into the same thing and needed to get out of the watering hole atmosphere to give each other a chance. It was an absolutely wonderful night. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82ejqj/">CassandraVindicated</a>

								<p>We met through this dating app. We didn't really plan on meeting that night because he just arrived here from another country but it was Friday night and we were hungry. We went to this Italian restaurant, ordered a bottle of wine and pizza. We talked and talked. We are in the same career field so it was a smooth conversation. No dead air and all. After that, we went walking back to his hotel. Disclaimer: We didn't hook up. We just talked and laughed and watched random funny videos on YouTube. We didn't even recognize that it was 5:30 in the morning. It was a fun first date. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82anim/">usoundgood4anasian</a>

								<p>I am a golfer. A few weeks ago, I met a fellow golfer through a mutual friend, and we played a round together. That day, I was firing on cylinders. From the tips on a pretty tough golf course, I managed 6 birdies and one bogey to shoot 67. Highlight of the round was when I birdied the last three holes, nearly holing out for eagle on the 18th to cap off the day. Needless to say, she was impressed beyond belief. We are currently talking and I like my prospects. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d828y7w/">darthhitlerIII</a>

								<p>My first date with my wife.  We got soup at this small stand, a complete oppitette of all the other dates I went at, then we hung out at my condos lounge to drink free coffee.  I showed her my lovely condo on the 23rd floor.  Since it was cold out (like snowing heavily) I convinced her to take the date into the shower, where we were buck naked and getting to know each other a lot better.  Plus the water pressure in a 50 story building is awesome. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d81y99l/">ooo-ooo-oooyea</a>

								<p>Hardly a date but I used to be into this girl that worked in the same building I did. I would always go have lunch with her and crap but one day in November she wanted to go out for a smoke so I thought, "lets go on the roof!". It was the first snow fall of the season and look very beautiful from the rooftop of the building. I was more mesmerized by her gleaming smile and snow flakes in her hair though. That was probably about 10 years ago? -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54h2nh/whats_the_best_first_date_youve_ever_had/d82jear/">rickor</a>
