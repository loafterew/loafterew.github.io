									Human resources is one of the most important organizations in any workplace. These people are responsible for keeping making sure employees feel safe, fulfilled, and engaged throughout their careers. However, this often means that they have to deal with downright absurd complaints from that guy (every company has one). Here is a compilation of some of the more crazy ones!

								<p>Was once asked to investigate a sexual harassment situation where three different women were coming on to a male coworker throughout their shift. I took down the details, got the names, easy peasy investigation so I thought.
A week later, nobody by these descriptions or names had ever worked for the company. I decided to talk to the gentleman again. After a lengthy conversation where things didn’t quite stack up I asked him how these women communicated with him.
I shit you not, with a straight face, he looks me in the eye and replies “telepathically” like I’m some kind of idiot.
I had never sent an employee for psychological evaluation up to that point and I hope never to have to again.
So yeah I was asked by a delusional schizophrenic to conduct a sex harassment investigation on the voices in his head. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/eswsp2s/">skittlesnwhiskey</a>

								<p>I was a manager and had to call our HR in on this one. We had a computer that was used by multiple people and a couple of girls complained that it had a virus and porn was always popping up when they turned it on in the morning.
I decided to have look see if someone was fucking around on the closing shift so I looked at the security footage and low and behold one of the  supervisors was watching porn and jerking off.
When we called him in he didn’t deny it but said technically he didn’t pull his dick out he just played with it in his pants so it’s not really that bad. The HR guy just looked at him didn’t say a word until after what seemed like forever the jerker said so I guess I’m fired and then walked out.

								<p>I'm not in HR, but someone called HR on me. I work with a few people that aren't that fluent in english. One of my coworkers was trying to explain to me what kind of tacos he ate and could not rememeber the word for stingrays. So he took my notebook and drew a picture of a stingrays and wrote the word turtle. So it looked like this: crudely drawn stingray+the word turtle. A lady I work with went through my notebook, saw the picture of the stingray plus the word turtle. She called HR because she thought I was writing notes about her in my notebook. She said that horribly drawn stingray plus the word turtle meant that I want to punch her in the face because she is slow like a turtle. Definitely a reach. I didn't get in trouble, I was just told by my boss that I'm not aloud to talk about turtles anymore in case it upsets her. I rarely talk about turtles, so this isn't really a problem for me.
****Edit: I'm still relatively new to reddit, so I'm not sure if this is an acceptable way to do this, but I am just going to edit the original post to answer everybody's burning question: He was not eating stingray/turtle tacos at work. He was telling me that was his favorite type of tacos to eat when he was at home. He is originally from Mexico and is in Iowa on a TN visa. Maybe in his coastal Mexican town it is normal to eat stingrays and turtles. I have no idea, really. All I know is I couldn't help him in the slightest when he asked me if I knew where to get stingray meat. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/eswdmc5/">nennern</a>

								<p>I told my coworker as professionally as I could that it wasn't appropriate for her to be using her phone while at work, teaching kids (supposedly). She spent all her time on Facebook, little kids would be screaming and whaling on each other literally 10 feet away and she was totally oblivious.
She complained by email to HR that I was rude and confrontational. They pulled me aside and told me to be more careful about how I spoke to coworkers. I told them my side of the story, they spoke to her again. She got a written warning, they didn't tell me what happened but I gather from office gossip that she lost her shit and started shouting at the HR staff. Rude and confrontational perhaps?
Anyway she's on her final warning now and she has a habit of hitting on the married dads of our kids, involving children in adult matters ("why hasn't your mummy paid your fees yet? Don't you want to come to daycare?") and generally being an un professional self-absorbed PITA so... Can't wait until she gets fired -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/eswa1vk/">tahituatara</a>

								<p>Not HR, but I have a story about an HR person that I will never forget.  The company I worked for hired a new girl in the HR dept.  She was young and very enthusiastic.  I'm sure this was probably her first job out of college.  Cut to a week or so later, and I'm riding in the elevator on the way up to the executive floor, and she steps in with me.  A couple floors later we stop, and an older gentleman wearing a polo shirt and jeans gets on.  Before I could greet him, she says, "pretty casual for a workday, huh?"  I had to stifle my laughter when he replied with, "that's one of the benefits of owning the company."  She turned an amazing color of red that I haven't seen since... it was all in good fun though, she ended up working there a long time. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esxcnpy/">steelie34</a>

								<p>Not HR but my company is too small to have one, so it just falls on me. Used to have an A/R clerk who would snack at her desk all day long. We are a pretty casual, laid back company so it's not a big deal as long as she was getting her work done. But, then it escalated to having food constantly being delivered; tacos in the morning, pizza at lunch, Chinese in the afternoon. It was bizarre, and made it difficult for her to work when she's eating full meals all day. I was on the fence about saying something until she brought in an Instant Pot. She plugged it in and cooked a freaking pork roast at her desk, poured in BBQ sauce she brought and ate on it all day. I was dumbfounded, it was so strange. I pulled her aside the next day and told her how unprofessional it was. She was shocked and told me I was being unfair because I never specifically said no one was allowed to bring in an Instant Pot. She truly seemed genuinely surprised that she wasn't allowed to do that. She scaled it down after that, but I sometimes wonder how much further she would have gone if I never said anything. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esvv7hu/">GonnaBeTrulyHonest</a>

								<p>I was the complainer.
My buddy was dating a girl that worked in HR at my company. Their relationship starting was totally unrelated to me (they had gone to college together). He dumped her and she didn't take it well and started threatening my job since I was still friends with him. I lodged a complaint just through the main email (hrcomplaints at company dot com or whatever it was). My complaint was assigned to...guess who! I ended up having to independently schedule a meeting with the VP of HR because the regular reps and middle managers were protecting their rep rather than believing me. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esvr6vw/">igotmyliverpierced</a>

								<p>You wouldn't believe the headaches that I received when management signed a new copier/printer lease which reduced the overall number of printers in exchange for centrally located multiplex copiers. Evidently, people feel their social standing is signified by if they have a printer (or two) in their office.
My favorite was an Executive Assistant who stated that, because she wears heels to work she couldn't walk to the new copier and requested that a reasonable accommodation would be to replace the printer she had in her office. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esvvas7/">yankee-white</a>

								<p>Not an HR employee, but I recently reported a bus driver for bringing his girl friend to work and rubbing her feet while driving. She sat on the spot right behind the driver and put her feet where he could reach for them with one hand.
I took a picture of the whole thing and debated on what to do with it for a while. On the one side, I didn't want this guy to lose his job nor have to explain why he was rubbing his girlfriend's feet at work (imagine the awkwardness). On the other side, he missed a turn and then took a U-turn on a downhill blind curve where we could've easily gotten nailed. In the end I came to the conclusion: when other people's lives are in your hands, that's what your hands should focus on. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esw2vwn/">Mixaroo</a>

A patient had asked if it was okay to remove her IV fluids cos she was going home. She was one of those people who was very convinced that if we took her fluids out, she would die. (She was admitted for the common cold, and uses her insurance to pay like this so she didn't have to spend a dime.)
Anyway, I told her that it's okay ma'am, we're just running 'regular saline water' through your IV. No more meds. You can go home today and we can take that out.
Get a notice from HR the next day saying I wasn't using proper medical terminology for IV fluids.
HR didn't do shit, they just tossed the complaint at me without asking questions. 🙄 -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/eswgmkc/">dancingfruit</a>

								<p>I worked in HR and my coworker hated me. She wanted someone else to get the job I did and she would complain about me to management for anything.
The final straw for everyone was when I sneezed and she slammed her keyboard on her desk, basically ran out of the room and didn't come back for 30 minutes.
Management called me in and said I was making too much noise. I told them I sneezed and they said she would complain about me every day so they didn't believe her but had to make it look like they were doing something.

								<p>I recently had HR tell me that one of my staff had been under supplied in his annual leave over the past few years, and he needed to take at least ten days off over the next six months to correct the leave liability.  Paid at a higher rate than usual to make up for the error, of course.  He could take a two week block or, say, a day off a week until he'd used the leave - his choice.
He was so enraged over being given extra paid holidays that he wrote to our General Manager to complain, screamed at me (his boss) "I know my rights!" refused the leave or even to discuss why he wouldn't take it.
Anyway, I wrote his performance review this week and there are multiple goals about professional, respectful behavior that need to be reached in order for him to get a raise this year.
Yeah, not so much.  Oh, and he still has to take the ten days off. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esxcwvx/">LibraryLuLu</a>

								<p>Not HR.
Used to work on an order packing line for a large distributor.  If we had an issue with any equipment on the line, we weren't permitted to correct it on our own.  We were supposed to turn on a light similar to what you'd see over a cashier's line in a grocery store, and one of the leads would come over to see what was wrong and fix it.  Suddenly I have an issue with my printer, and since I already caught hell for not following procedure on it before, I figured I'd try to do as told so I didnt get my wrist slapped again.  Go to turn my light on, and imagine that, it doesn't work either.  Yelled the leads name to get his attention, since we weren't supposed to wander away from the line either.  Next day I was called in to HR for shouting the leads name.  One of the clowns on the line beside mine didn't approve of my shouting. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esvz253/">SpedWagon</a>

								<p>Not an HR rep but I work in the produce Dept with this lazy POS. He will complain to HR about anything and everything. We had a new team lead start and he's trying to get everyone to work a little harder, make a name for himself and what not.
So one day lazy POS is filling apples but doesn't go through them or rotate. Team lead cones up and asks if he rotated and POS says yes. Team lead asks, then why are there cold apples on top of warm ones? (Newer apples obviously came from the cooler).
Lazy POS literally drops the box in his hand and rushes upstairs to HR.
Edit: since so many want closure, I'll try to do my best.
He cries to HR at least once every other week. It's always about stupid stuff so they never really tell him what he wants to hear. They just spend time listening to his problem and say they will talk to the people responsible. They never follow up because no one is going anything HR worthy, besides him wasting company time.
He was once on the sales floor digging for gold in his ear and a customer wrote a complaint to corporate. He tried to go to HR about our manager for showing him the complaint and saying that his ear itched and what was he supposed to do. They told him obviously go to the bathroom, itch and then wash your hands. You're working with food for God's sake.
Not HR related but this guy and I share the same name. He is the equivalent to a Walmart greeter because of how little work he gets done and how much talking he does. (Many managers have tried to address this but it's almost impossible to get fired where we work). He will get customer compliments every week, some of them are literally word for word every week.
The thing is, the ones that aren't the same wording, are usually mine. We work in the same department but I do different things than him. For every compliment we receive, we're supposed to get a $5 food coupon we can use in the store. I haven't received one of those in at least 4 or 5 years because he always says their his. If I try to argue, he will literally look at the customers name on the compliment form and say "oh me and andy have been friends for years, I know this one is for me" -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esw81xv/">AverageCartPusher</a>

								<p>My HR department once fell for a phishing email and sent everyone's W2s to a random hacker. HR then informed everyone via a mass email, with no read receipts, at 9 p.m. on a Friday... even though multiple people were on vacation and had left instructions to be called in an emergency.
When I got back from my trip a week later and expressed my concern about her not actually notifying me about this, she totally brushed it off. I said "do you realize that I need to freeze my credit, and I'm 7 days late in doing so?" She said "no, don't freeze your credit, you won't be able to use your credit cards if you do!"
Another time, during a worker's comp claim, I needed to speak to our claims adjuster and she said "an adjuster doesn't get assigned until after the claim is settled." (That's the exact opposite of how that works.)

I was making a coffee for an older late maybe mid sixties, she told me to heat it to 95 C°  (5 C° off boiling point) which not only is insanely hot but also against company policy as it actually ruins the coffee, I did it anyway cause I couldn’t be bothered to fight with her, this lady actually came round to my side of the machine and watched as I made it, I finished the coffee and went to put it on the side where all coffees go to put a lid on. Before I could, she intercepted my hand and spilled it all over her own hand, this coffee was ridiculously hot and must have hurt a fair bit, she then proceeded to scream at me that she was going to “sue me and the company” to which I just said “go ahead I have nothing” -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/eswzn1t/">ImCorrosive</a>

								<p>From wife as she has worked HR for 17 years. She is more on the legal side of HR for a huge national grocery chain. Employee gets written up for disappearing during shift. Manager and supervisors call him multiple times. Employee returns 30 mins later like nothing happened. Did not have a valid excuse like I was outside with a customer or whatever...they looked too. He files a union grievance and complaint. Union schedules an arbitration hearing at their offices so wife has to make an hour drive to represent the company, store manager needs to be on hand as he issued the writeup. Normally would just be a 'fine, don't do it again and we will came into the union.' But wife found out the property manager just had perimeter cameras installed. Wife shows up to the meeting. Clerk brings his mom even though he is 18/19. Dude says he never hear calls for him to come to front. She explains that there are loudspeakers in the back dock area. He says he wasn't there. She lets him keep talking. Then she opens her laptop and plays a video "is that you?" Dude goes white as on the screen he is seen lifting a local prostitutes skirt and fucking her. Turns out the guys gf worked a different department at the same store and was there that same day. He ends up quitting, and gf breaks up with him. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esxmvci/">shreddingsolo</a>

								<p>Not HR but I talk to people so I know a few stories.
Here's my favorite in terms of how ridiculous it is.
HR Director found hookah in the women's bathroom, it wasn't hidden or anything, it was just there in the plain sight on the floor. Turns out one employee is addicted to smoking hookah and she brought it on her first day of work. She then demanded to be allowed to smoke hookah in the bathroom but they came to the agreement that she can take a break every day to go out and smoke it in the nearby hookah place if she wants to.
Little background: I work in IT in Ukraine, IT specialists here make good money, and they are also spoiled as fuck due to high demand. So people complain about all sorts of stupid shit all the time, like free lunches are served in containers they don't like, or elevator needs and AC and etc.
Edit: "elevator needs an AC", not elevator and ac, that is reasonable :D -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/eswquhb/">dial_m_for_me</a>

								<p>I don't know if this story fits, but I'll tell it anyway.
I went to HR once to complain that my manager refused to give me a couple of vacation days.  The HR lady reminded me about the boilerplate rule that "vacation time must be mutually acceptable to the employee and the company.".
I then pulled out six more vacation requests that had all been denied, including one that was denied -- in writing -- for a reason that was not permitted.  I asked her if the company is allowed to say that it's never acceptable?
My last request was un-denied. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esxh81e/">hymie0</a>

								<p>I was the person complained about and, two decades later, I'm still salty about it.
I got called in to the HR manager's office one day and told that I was being written up for discussing "inappropriate and sexual things" in the office.  I had never done that, ever.  I was still a very-much closeted gay boy at the time so there wasn't a chance in hell I was going to talk about my sex life to the middle-aged women I worked with.
"Who complained about me?" I asked, being young and naive.
"We can't tell you that.  There's confidentiality rules," HR said.
"Okay, I understand.  What was it that I supposedly said?"
"We can't tell you that, either.  You may use that to discover who lodged the complaint."
"So, I'm being written up because an anonymous person complained that I was saying sexual things in the office, but you won't tell me who complained or what I supposedly said?"
"That's right.  Now, please sign this form to indicate that you understand the severity of your infraction."
"No, I won't do that."
"You have to."
It was a stalemate for almost 20 minutes while I refused to sign their form.  They threatened to fire me, but I still refused to sign.  In the end, she made some comment on the form about my "unwillingness to participate in the process."
Then, to top it off, the rest of the office wondered why I completely stopped speaking to all of them altogether.  I refused to engage in any of the usual non-office-related talk.  If it was not 100% required conversation in order to do my job, I flat out ignored my coworkers' presence.
Again, I was called in to HR and reprimanded for my abrasive demeanor.
I quit that job shortly thereafter. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esy0wip/">pupHD</a>

								<p>Was handed a handwritten letter from my boss, as he said “I think you might need this”.
The letter had been written by an employee, who let herself into the boss’s office and left it on his desk while he was out, complaining she was unhappy about how the staff were “mistreated and disrespected” because he often left during the day to “go shopping and get haircuts” (this rarely happened, probably not even once a month), and that she thought it was appalling that he left for a week over Christmas to see his family, while they weren’t allowed more than 3 days off over Christmas.
Had a meeting with her and literally had to explain that he is the owner of the company and can come and go as he pleases, that he works evenings and weekends when others don’t, and that the week off was the first time he had taken holiday in 8 months, unlike the rest of the staff who get 28 days throughout the year.
She looked at me, expressionless, and said “and? I want a week off at Christmas. If he gets it, I should have it.” I told her her complaint had been logged and we’ll look into it. She walked out, relayed a different version of our conversation to a dozen employees and gossiped about the boss. She was gone within a month of the letter.

								<p>After 20 years in HR, I have too many to remember. The most recent was on Monday when an employee emailed me with a request to remind everyone to be careful with scented lotions. Her area reeked from something that smelled like Moroccan oil. These kind of emails are a bomb waiting to go off. Everyone gets paranoid, and I end up replying to 50 people that they smell fine and, yes, please keep wearing your deodorant. I told her that I would rather address it with the individual, so let me know who it was. After literally sniffing our way through the cube farm, we discovered the smell was coming from her own desk drawer. We couldn't find the stinky culprit, so she ended up throwing everything out.

								<p>I was once summoned to HR. When i got there, one of my employees was already sitting in the head HR lady's office with a "WTF, Really?" look on his face.
HR lady goes into a diatribe about how this employee is a chauvinistic pig that doesnt respect women and thinks he is better than all women. On and on about just how awful this guy is. Employee was my lead software dev and was awesome at his job and a great guy otherwise.
Turns out, HR lady had asked him to write a spreadsheet full of formulas to calculate Open Enrollment dollar values for withholding based on all the available options and individual pay rates.
He told her that "i can help, but ive got this payment gateway project thats due and dont really have a ton of time. Can i just show you how to get started instead?" - and thats how the argument started.
My response was "OK employee, you can leave. Thank you" then i told her that if Excel didnt open - thats IT. Custom sheets with formulas and pay data for employees - thats HR and that i could recommend some resources for learning Excel.
That bitch was constantly trying to get IT to do her job for her. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esyiwuq/">themastermatt</a>

								<p>Not HR but a complaint raised against me
"Hostile and unfriendly behaviour"
I had to explain to the head of HR that the complainant had walk up behind me whilst I was relieving myself at a urinal, launching into a detailed explanation of their computer problem. Rather than say "shut the fuck up, reboot your pc and leave me alone" I replied "please log a ticket for me"
So yeah, prompting them to follow the proper procedure, never mind accosting me whilst urinating was me being hostile...
The complaint was promptly filed in the under desk circular receptacle -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esy9kyd/">Moontoya</a>

								<p>Oblig not HR, just a witness.
I worked for an outsource call center, so all we had for resources was what was provided by the client. A customer called in and had some documentation that conflicted with our info. The agent called a supe over and was explaining the situation, showing her where the discrepancy was in our training materials. He was sitting the whole time, she was standing. He got referred to HR because he was “aggressively wielding” the three-ring binder at her.
I was in a raised seat a few rows over so I was asked for my account. HR assured me it’s completely confidential. They then interviewed another supe and began their convo with “what jrs says happened was [complete mischaracterization of my statement].” So that was fun.
There was also the time after my cat had passed (she was 22 and I’d had her the whole time, so I was not in a normal frame of mind), and I hugged a (fellow female) coworker I’d hung out with outside of work, and I asked her how her kitty was. She reported me for sexual harassment. I was pretty shocked. I was “asked” to meet with HR, so I explained my mental state, and that I’d been to her house and seen her cat, and so was asking after him. Once I said that, that was basically case closed.
C---, would not recommend. (And no, I wouldn’t hug a coworker again.)

								<p>One gal had an obsession with mini muffins. She brought a 12 pack with her to work 3-4 times a week. Never labeled them as hers. And frequently left them on the ‘shared foods counter’, where it’s up for grabs to the whole staff.
One day, someone who was newer accidentally ate one of the mini muffins. Pandemonium followed. There was screaming. Tears. Thrown pastries. Threats of physical violence.
I had to complete a report explaining that the scuffle ensued because another woman had ‘violated her mini muffins’, and the whole time this woman is FUMING AND CRYING, like someone ate her firstborn child instead of a muffin. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esy1esp/">cathythenephilim</a>

								<p>So this is quite the tale but I will try to keep it brief.
Two employees enter in to a relationship and begin to go a bit above and beyond with PDA's. We're talking full on over the clothes action here. In our workspace, the breakroom, on the floor of the locker room, against the wall outside etc.
Employees are asked to tone it down due to inappropriateness etc. Proceed to accuse every manager of being homophobic, creating a toxic work environment, victimisation, bullying etc. formal complaints abound.
Turns out one of these employees has been threatening to kill people, being generally aggressive and scary etc.
They both leave of their own accord before they can be managed out.
cut to a year later one reapplies for a position in the company which is rejected on multiple genuine business grounds. Immediately receive a HR notification - they made a complaint that we wouldn't rehire them.. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esy8la7/">Wrathful_Man</a>

								<p>Once had to tell a guy a Court Order means the company cannot ignore it, regardless of how much he shouted at me or threatened to kill me.
I did genuinely look into it because it was the first I ever heard of anyone having money ordered by a court to be diverted. So our Payroll team sent over the Court Order and session dates it all took place in. I asked our Solicitors to look it up and see what went down, since it was all a matter of Public record.
Ends up our Employee never bothered going to the Court to contest the Order and just ignored it.
So armed with this knowledge I brought him in and laid it all out.
Initally he listened and just sat and waited for me to finish. Then after I'm done and explain nothing further can be done nor can we amend the payments. He explodes at me, personally blaming me for all his problems and that he can't afford these payments.
Finally after listening to him shout at me for 10 minutes and blaming me for his problems. I dropped my professional demour and flat out told him. That if he bothered to defend himself in court as much as he fruitlessly was trying to do here. Maybe he wouldn't be in this position.
At that point he threatened to kill me, but shouted it loud enough that HR outside the meeting room heard it. My HR manager came in and just told him to leave and was fired on gross misconduct. At which point he tried to swing a punch at my HR Manager (who was an Amateur boxer). He knocked the guy out, put him in the recovery position and called 999 for an Ambulance and Police to attend our work.
It was a most eventful HR meeting I ever had. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esyzbfg/">Frymewitheggs</a>

								<p>Small business so I'm everything and for the most part, the HR stuff is, I reported you to labor and this is why.
Dumbest one ever was for not paying overtime.  He worked 35 hours for me, and 20 hours somewhere else...not my business.  He felt he was entitled to 15 hours of overtime pay.  I had to spend a day with labor showing them 3 years of time sheets.
Second dumbest, I had an employee repeatedly making a serious mistake, but it was so simple.  You could really only make it by being negligent.  Anyways, I went with I trained him poorly, so for a few weeks, everytime he made a mistake, I pointed it out and showed him how it should have been done.  Always one on one.  I wont even pull someone aside if anyone else is around.  He reported me for bullying.  Everytime I pointed out his mistake, " it made him feel less of himself."  Labor didnt bother with that one, I started writing him up and he quit 2 weeks later. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9b8h6/hr_employees_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/esyij3a/">notyetcomitteds2</a>
