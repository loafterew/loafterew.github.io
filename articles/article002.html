									Relationships can be hard, whether they are social, professional, or romantic. Some people possess obvious red flags that you need to watch out for, but with others it may not be so obvious. However, there are often many GREEN flags that are overlooked or taken for granted. Here are a compilation of some of the most unique ones!

								<p>General mindfullness, the little things you don't really notice if you don't pay attention. Pushing a chair in after sitting in it, asking questions and being involved with you. You can learn a lot about somebody by paying attention to how they listen, and having a partner that listens is an absolutely amazing feeling. There is a huge gap between "being aware of what you're saying" and understanding what you're saying. A good listener is priceless. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et2niu0/">Bukkake_Bakery</a>

Another one is when they remember that you've done certain things with them and bring it up from time to time.

								<p>Treating people you don't have to treat respectfully, with respect.
I'm currently an Uber Eats driver and I've found the huge contrast in the manner  hospitality staff treat me when I'm picking up orders, compared to when I'm a customer. It seems because I'm not a paying customer, service staff seem to think it's okay to treat me like shit or a lesser individual. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et2un6q/">anarchy420swag</a>

								<p>How they treat ex-partners altought they (exes) did them wrong. No feelings of wanting "revenge". One of the reasons I decided to move in with my now boyfriend.
Edit: little clarification. This isn't about shit talking in private, that's emotional and understandable if something nasty happened. This is about what the person decides to focus on then and if they deliberetaly try to destroy and ruin their exes life. Threatening and stalking and just trying everything to make it extra hard when they just want to move on. And I think this says a lot about a person in general and about how they deal with rejection and failure. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et2n82p/">Waldkatzl</a>

								<p>Good communication. If you can communicate really well with someone, that is HUGE. Quality communication between two people can be way more important in a relationship than compatibility and is huge part of good chemistry. For example, one of my friends has gone on a couple dates with this one girl and the first date they talked for 3 hours and the second date they talked for 4 hours, but he's not sure if he wants to see this girl again.

								<p>Admitting when they don't understand something and asking questions about it until they do.  A few years ago I was at a party with a friend of mine, and another friend-of-a-friend who is a physicist who worked for a startup that produced specialized magnets for quantum computing.  My friend asked the startup guy about his work, and he explained it, and everybody else in the room just nodded and acted like they knew what he was talking about, but she said, "I don't understand, can you explain that a different way?" And he did, and then she kept asking questions for quite a while, and by the end of it we actually all DID understand what his company did instead of just being polite and pretending we did, and it was super interesting. A couple of people thanked her afterward basically for having the self-confidence to admit she didn't have any clue what he was talking about and not being afraid it would make her look dumb, because the rest of us were all content to pretend we knew instead of actually taking the initiative to find out. I respected her so much for that. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et3e3vt/">Yellowbug2001</a>

								<p>I noticed once I got into my 30's that all my friends would break up over green flags.
"OH she was doing MYYY dishes! Like bitch back off!"
"He was just always asking me how I was doing and trying to be deep, so annoying."
"She just was too something...idk, she got me a birthday card and said I love you."
"He kept trying to see me every week. Then when I said no, he didn't call me for a whole week!"
"She wanted to date, but she said she also was focused on working 5 days a week. I need a commitment...to ME."
Edit: OK, a handful of comments about why I am friends with them if these people are so horrible/terrible/selfish etc.
I have worked with many of them for over a decade, and as anyone knows who has held down a long term job; sometimes you make friends with people (even if they have character-flaws) if you see them everyday for years.
These people all have individually donated thousands of their dollars to local charities, and all have volunteered to help with adopting struggling families, domestic abuse survivors, childrens charities, etc. I have watched them pull out hundreds of dollars from their wallet on the spot to help support a co-worker who is sick, injured, or just had a child and have to take un-paid time off. Most of them will drop anything they're doing to come and help you if your in bind (a friend came and towed me, 120 miles from where we live). Another not only fixed an exhaust issue on my truck, but fabricated a brand new flow-thru and helped install it and refused payment of any kind.
People can be selfish, shallow, rude, etc. They can also be incredibly generous and kind at the same time. We all have character flaws. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et3ahly/">fruitytrailmix</a>

								<p>Honesty early on. When my husband and I started dating, I told him how much I wanted to see a certain movie, and for one of our first dates, he invited me over to watch said movie, and said he’d make dinner for me. I was a little nervous to go, because I figured he’d meant “watch a movie”... I get inside, he’s got pasta cooking, and the movie is all set up and ready on his TV. We ate (terrible) pasta, watched a movie, and that was the day I decided to keep seeing him (but that I’d do the cooking). -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et3bbt8/">lindsaybethhh</a>

He doesn't usually say anything about it or notice me "acting up" but this time he did and said "Bunnixie, stop. Your skin is fine." And when I kept looking at it he just casually closed the mirror and kept driving. Like it wasn't any big thing to him, just something that needed to be fixed.
Example2: I was screaming at him cause he was about to mess up my wet nails, it was playful but I still screamed bloody murder cause I worked hard on my nails. He kept trying to touch them and was tickling me. He said "Bunnixie you're gonna hurt your voice!" And was actually genuinely concerned. I'm a vocalist and he knows how much singing means to me.. but I didn't realized he cared like that. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et3j335/">bunnixie</a>

								<p>If you live with people, being nice to your roommates. Potential partners/hookups have some incentive to be nice to your friends, because they know you’ll probably listen to your friends if they tell you your partner sucks. But a roommate might not have that much influence over you, so a person who’s just faking being considerate might drop the act around them. When we were still casually dating, my now boyfriend brought my roommates snacks just because, always checked if we were watching the TV too loud, etc. and years later he’s still one of the most considerate people I know. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9suu6/what_are_some_huge_green_flags_that_are_often/et37wda/">lucyfrost</a>
