									With more tech listening and talking back to us than ever before, it's hardly a surprise that people suspect their privacy is being intruded upon by government and corporations alike. Search engines like Google do their level best to target ads and products based on what they know about us, which raises the chilling question: what exactly do they know about us? Here are real-life accounts of what people found Google had collected from their data.

								<p>4 years ago my dog passed away and I remember googling stuff related to it.
A week ago, Just like any other day, I was using youtube. And what I noticed is going to be weird. I was being shown advertisements related to dogs health products and dog guides. This was all of a sudden and it had never popped up before.
Yesterday.... my dog fell sick. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g45aps/people_who_have_read_the_data_that_google_has/fnvlnjz/">shampoo_and_dick</a>

								<p>propriety media. I work in entertainment, and had been working on a project involving various video files which were shared to me via google drive. after the project was over the share was deleted and we had to ensure we had removed all related media and sign various bits of paperwork to confirm we hadn't kept any data. 4 months later I downloaded my google data, the file was massive and I wasn't sure why as its mostly text, then I found a video file from the old project that was stashed in my data...needless to say I nigh shit myself, then scrubbed it from my PC and pretended I never saw anything. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g45aps/people_who_have_read_the_data_that_google_has/fnvnryf/">fatflatfish</a>

								<p>My friends used to live opposite a well known brothel and google thought I was checking into the brothel everytime I visited my friends' house across the street. Needless to say it was an embarrassing thing for google to ask me to review while I was showing my family some holiday photos. 5 stars, would visit again. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g45aps/people_who_have_read_the_data_that_google_has/fnvyiqi/">TheRed7God</a>

								<p>Locations. Turned that shit off immediately. Who really knows if it’s completely off. I’m leaning towards it isn’t.
Speaking of, how on earth does google know when I get in my car? I can understand leaving in the morning, same time every day, fine. But I drive multiple vehicles for work and leave sporadically in a 5 hour window, it’s never consistent.
I’ll drive 10 trucks but the second I get in my truck it tells me how long it’s going to take to get home. I’d like to know how it knows.
Edit; I don’t drive a Tesla or anything like that, just a bare bones truck. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g45aps/people_who_have_read_the_data_that_google_has/fnvyoiq/">INTP36</a>

								<p>I was happy to find that most of the "interests" they had pinned on me were hilariously inaccurate.
What I was unhappy to find was that they knew my job had changed before it actually did (this is logical as it requires a lot of googling). When I did searches at my previous job for related things on my personal devices, they somehow knew these were "one-offs" and knew not to use it to build a profile on me. They know a lot of things I never search, get emails about, or discuss on Google-owned platforms. I have a few blockers stacked on top of each other on my laptop so that is safe, but my phone... well I need to be more careful about that.
