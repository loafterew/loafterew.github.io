									There are good things about being a man and good things about being a woman. There are also very bad things about being a man or woman. What with the grass being always greener, here are what people envy in the opposite sex.

								<p>As a man, being able to be friendly with kids that aren't my own and nurturing in general without being worried about how it's perceived by others, well some at least, as being sinister or weird.
Don't like to say good things about myself, raised to be modest and all. But I'm really good with kids. Able to engage with them at a level they understand and teach them while being friendly. Probably comes from having a sis 6 years younger. Be patient, entertain and protect. I understand why people are suspicious these days but if I was a woman I don't think I'd have to worry about it so much. That would be nice.
Screw having periods though I have some friends who are often absolutely wrecked by those.
lol how soon til someone posts asking What is the thing you don't envy about the opposite sex do you think? -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3zv0a/what_is_the_thing_you_envy_of_the_opposite_sex/fnuuh99/">Fuzzyphilosopher</a>

								<p>Female here.
Things I envy about men:
-Decent pockets in clothing
-Never expected to wear heels
-Can pee standing up (without making a mess)
-Much less shaving needed to be socially acceptable in summer
-Can usually reach higher shelves without a step ladder.
Things I don't envy:
-Out-of-context boners
-Expectation to never be emotionally vulnerable
-While the face has a lot less surface area than everything I'm expected to shave, it seems like a much more complicated job
-Much less choice for work clothes
-General societal views on masculinity and lack of freedom to act outside of that without judgement (a woman not being feminine is praised, a man not being masculine is ridiculed).
EDIT: I see now that I was horribly misguided about how easy it is for men to pee standing up without making a mess. Thank you for educating me, men of Reddit. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3zv0a/what_is_the_thing_you_envy_of_the_opposite_sex/fnvdk28/">MerylSquirrel</a>

								<p>How easy reproduction is for men. Yes I understand they have their own issues but i would swap any day. The constant unease when you know you are close to your period. Is it discharge or did I bleed? If I stand up will I leave a mark? The monthly general uncomfortableness, pain, moods, bloating and cost of periods. The side effects of birth control and cost of it. The fear of unwanted pregnancies. The stigma of abortions. And the fact men don’t have to screw up their bodies to bring kids into the world.
Very very envious of this. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3zv0a/what_is_the_thing_you_envy_of_the_opposite_sex/fnuvdjl/">SataySticks</a>

								<p>I just want to be listened to. You have no idea how impossible it is to be a woman in a small town where everyone still holds the same 1950s values. Nobody ever takes me seriously, nobody listens to what I have to say, and nobody thinks I have good ideas until a man repeats them. And I can't even get angry about it because then I get "you're cute when you're mad ;)" or "is it That Time Of The Month?"
Also, being able to exist on the Internet without getting pictures of people's genitals sent to me all the time would be nice. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3zv0a/what_is_the_thing_you_envy_of_the_opposite_sex/fnuxq2a/">ArcadiaPlanitia</a>

I hate that I can't sit down and get to know someone without them thinking that I want to get in their pants. Also, people cross the street so they don't walk next to me at night (I've started crossing the street first so they don't have to and because I don't want anyone to feel unsafe).
