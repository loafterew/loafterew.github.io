									The driving motivation of the animal kingdom, 90% of rom-coms, and most 20-somethings, sex is something that everyone has an opinion on. Some people play their cards close to their chest, some love to chat about it, and some people will say anything to strangers on the internet. Here are thirty submissions from some of those people about their unpopular opinions.

								<p>Women need to communicate better.
Many of my partners have liked guys taking control and going for it in the bedroom. I've had an ex I didn't end up having sex with who got pissed that despite all her teasing I never pinned her down and fucked her.
Nope. No. Not fair. We live in a world where you've made it abundantly clear that no means no and silence isn't consent. It's now your responsibility as a woman to communicate that you want to be fucked. I've never not communicated my consent, and women who don't do so are wrong. The enjoyment/thrill/fantasy of having a man go caveman and just take you is unfair and inappropriate to pursue.

								<p>Both partners should initiate every now and then. Not just one of the other. It makes both people feel desired and sexy, and if you’re in a relationship, it feels like less of an obligation.
Also, my hot take. It’s ok for a man to say no. And I think women should learn to respect that as much as it is ok for a woman to say no -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g4727o/whats_your_unpopular_sex_opinion/fnvypou/">The_Dragon346</a>

								<p>You should not be labeled as a pervert/whore if you have a very High sex drive. It's ways less easy than it looks.
It even shatters couples sometimes. A happy sex life is normal. If your happy sex life means doing it one or several times a day, then it's okay there's nothing wrong with that.
Edit: The opposite is also true. Having a very low sex drive isn't an issue, if your happiness in your sex life goes with doing it more rarely, or even if you're asexual, there's nothing to be ashamed of. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g4727o/whats_your_unpopular_sex_opinion/fnvxqpg/">Kermit_Purple</a>

								<p>WHY THE HELL IS HORSE FUCKING BECOMING SO MAINSTREAM?!
Seriously the amount of, especially animated, pornos or girls or guys getting fucked by an equine (horse) of some type is unsettling. Its not even the furries this time, its the chads and staceys that are fapping to it.
I admit i got some pretty fucked up kinks, but when i go to the front page of a porn site, even pornhub, i’ll almost always find one ‘horse fucks girl’ thingy.
Even my friend, who two weeks prior said i was delusional, admitted to me yesterday that he had infact seen the influx of horse porn and was sorry to have ever doubted me. But for the third time in my life, i’m not happy about being right

Enthusiam is where most of the enjoyment comes from. Pleasuring your partner shouldn't be some kind of personal sacrifice that you have to endure. Find something else you could do for them if you don't like oral.
