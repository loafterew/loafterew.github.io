									Some things sound fantastic on paper, but don't quite hold up in real life. Whether it's an underwhelming tourist attraction, a poorly planned event, or a misrepresented activity, we have all had our fair share of opportunities that didn't go quite as we would have hoped. Here, people share some of their best examples of this below!

								<p>Being a swinger. The idea of a ton of novel sex sounds great but it doesn't really work that way. You have to spend all your time looking for people to hook up. Get connected enough that a meet up can get scheduled. More scheduling. Crappy sex with strangers you may or may not really find attractive. Awkward emotional stuff to    ' work through' with your partner. Oh yeah and your partner is having sex with people ypu may find simply awful. In the end it's all logistics and embarrassing situations. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/euebby8/">zeppelinonnpr</a>

								<p>I'm gonna get hate for this, but going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The idea of it is terrific, and it's certainly an adventure. But I went when I was 19, and it was incredibly chaotic and overwhelming. I had college friends who continued to go every year, but once was definitely enough for me.
EDIT: I'm getting some flack for the fact that I was only 19 when I went. Please trust me that this did NOT matter in New Orleans back in 2000. I looked about 15, and I still got served everywhere I went, without getting carded. Me not having fun had nothing to do with whether or not I was sober! -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/eue5b51/">PepurrPotts</a>

								<p>Attending an NFL game.
The NFL's dirty little secret is that the gameday experience is total shit compared to grilling up some food at your house, cracking open a bunch of good beer, and watching with your friends on your big screen TV.

								<p>when i was a kid, my dad worked at the local deli in town to make some cash on the side and i thought it was the coolest job EVER. i loved walking in and seeing him work and even though it was making sandwiches and prepping catering orders, i always like “when i’m old enough to get a job that’s what i’m gonna do!”
well, i turn 14 and the bosses offer me a job almost as soon as my birthday came around. i used to think working in a restaurant was the coolest thing in the world.... until i worked in food service and it actually is the worst thing ever. nothing better than working long hours for minimum and being screamed at by rude and angry customers.
i think what made it seem cool was just that my dad is a generally calm and happy guy, so he made working a pretty difficult job seem fun because he had such a calm demeanor about it. for that i give him a ton of respect
EDIT:// wow didn’t expect this to get this much notice. to clarify some things: i didn’t hate my job. it was a lot of hard work for minimal pay but the bosses always treated me well. but i don’t have the patience to handle it for as many years as he did. he was able to deal with a lot of stuff with a smile on his face that would normally cause a lot of people (like myself) to absolutely lose their shit. it was a great job, but it wasn’t the perfect job that i imagined it as when i was little -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/eueuofv/">peachplastic</a>

I go hard at a bar once a year, on my birthday, when all I want is for my friends to make sure I don't wander too far. I usually have a great fucking time dancing, socializing, and probably making an idiot of myself at karaoke. I wake up the next day feeling like shit every time and that's all i need to remind myself why i don't drink. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/eue37fs/">buttpuckering</a>

								<p>I'm probably going to be argued with here but.. Being an artist(or art major)
Imagine this; you get to create a lot of shit, there's a fictional world at your fingertips. Sounds nice, right?
Well then imagine some BITCH named Bethany goes and repost(without credit, btw) YOUR work on her Insta to promote her shitty MLM who is just about as annoying as some elder bitch named Shannon who fucking gives out raisins and pencils(if you're lucky, peppermints) on GODDAMNED HALLOWEEN and no matter how much you tell the bitch to put it down she won't because "what you gonna do? Uwu reppooort mwe? Well dat just pwoves how much of a wittle bwitch you are. You warely wowked on it! Its just a shitty dwawing! I could do dat with mwy eyes cwosed! Uwuwuwuuwu"(DO IT YOURSELF THEN, BETHANY, YOU FAT MIDDLE-AGED BITCH.)
Or; You're getting a little stressed, reasonable right? Every career induces stress once in a while. Well just as you think this some BASTARD named Cleetus Hubert Jr. burst through your wall, completely busting it down with his huge ass beer belly, and he cries like that of an eagle, letting his patriotic pride sink in like the feeling of your impending doom, " OH YOU THINK YOU'RE STRESSED? WELL I SHOVED A CACTUS UP MY ASS WHILE I MOTORBOATED SHREDDED WOOD. BUT NO I DON'T DESERVE TO BE STRESSED BECAUSE SOME ART MAJOR IS. SO LET ME FIX YOU UP A NICE CUP OF WATER TO RELIEVE YOUR NERVES, YOU LITTLE BITCH."
hello and thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
Edit: Hello again! I see some people worrying if the Bethany situation is real, and fortunately I can say no. Well... Not anymore. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/euefexx/">mxrbids</a>

								<p>Going to any type of convention? A couple days after the actual convention you'll think that you had loads of fun but while at the actual convention you're utterly miserable. Hungry, thirsty, feet hurting, out of money, tired and most likely bored if you're waiting in line for any signings or panels. Also you're probably very uncomfortable if you are cosplaying or very worried if a piece is about to break, if you bought action figures or art you're probably annoyed about having to carry it.
In conclusion: conventions sound fun on paper, conventions seem like they were fun after a day or two has passed, but while you are actually there it's the embodiment of hell. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/euemc53/">possumhomie</a>

								<p>Music festivals.
They’re hot, crowded, the lines are long for both drinks and the bathroom (aka porta-potties, another strike) so you actually spend like half your time in one line or the other while you remember you paid a couple hundred dollars to do this.
Also, because it’s so crowded you can’t really even go from stage to stage completely defeating the purpose of having all the acts in one place. If you want to see the headliner you have to camp out at that stage all day.
If you genuinely want to hear a bunch of bands, music festivals are not the place for it. In reality the bands are just background music for people who want instagram pictures of them in their flowers crown. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/euebmfw/">greenline_chi</a>

I rarely buy clothes for myself, but it's not because I don't care about my appearance I just genuinely hate shopping. My mom and sisters are like shopping pros, loads of shoes, clothes and I'm still wearing flip flops I bought from Walmart 3 yrs ago for $8. I'm trying to get myself to buy a couple of things a year for myself to maybe get into it. Oh, even my mom and sister has offered to buy me something online and I decline because I don't want to look at Kohl's to peruse their clearance crap. No thank you. (I take care of my clothes and shoes, it's not like I'm walking around looking like a ragamuffin.

								<p>Being a videogame QA tester.
I've had a handful of people aspiring to be video game testers, thinking that testing games as in 'playing them' - and I mean games only - all the time is a quick and easy way to make your hobby your job while making money in the process.
The reality is much different and not nearly as fun as one may think.
You will be playing the same boring part in a game over and over and over again,
let along the game might not be even that good to begin with.
Soon enough you'll be completely burnt out, sick of playing games. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cg1xr0/whats_something_that_seems_fun_but_is_actually/euettce/">BlackMetalDash</a>
