           From artificial intelligence algorithms capable of acting as virtual wealth managers to
apps designed to allow individuals the ability to trade stocks with the tap of their fingers,
initiatives in STEM have rapidly modernized the finance industry. These undertakings are just a
few of many examples that demonstrate the incredible power technology has to democratize the
tools necessary for financial health and wellness. The automation in finance brought about by
technology has allowed individuals increased access to resources such as loans, wealth
management advice, and investing insights. The financial industry’s embrace of STEM
initiatives has allowed the field to become more modernized and accessible.
As a student pursuing a degree in computer science at Northwestern University, I hope to
obtain a career as an algorithmic trading developer. Using my expertise in machine learning, I
hope to create trading algorithms that not only rely on underlying mathematical and statistical
modelling techniques, but also employ vast amounts of data to assist traders in making more
informed decisions when buying or selling securities. By coupling the vast amounts of
computing power and available today with advanced techniques in machine learning, I hope to
work on algorithms that utilize everything from historical price data and SEC filings to industry
and macroeconomic trends when calculating future values of equity prices. Being able to work
on such challenging and intellectually stimulating project would be an incredibly fulfilling
experience, as I am very passionate about the intersection of finance and technology.
        
        Why are you submitting an application to participate in Belvedere Trading's Externship Program?
As someone with an affinity for computer science and economics, I am fascinated with and hope
to pursue a career in electronic trading. Belvedere Trading’s Externship Program is a unique opportunity
that will allow me to gain exposure to this field and understand the career opportunities available to me
after graduation.
The idea of being able to work on a fast-paced trading desk is one that excites me, and I would
love to see myself working in this industry. However, I also have a passion for programming, and would
enjoy working with and enhancing the sophisticated, low-latency technology underlying the firm’s
operations. Belvedere Trading is unique in that it provides new hires with the opportunity to work as a
Hybrid Trader Trainee, a role that combines my two passions into a fulfilling career experience. By
partaking in this externship, I will gain insight into the various job roles at the firm, including the Hybrid
Trader Trainee, and how they interact with each other. Additionally, I will be able to connect with
professionals across the firm and grow my network.
Belvedere Trading values its employees as one of its most important assets. The firm places a
great emphasis on the well-being of its employees, an attribute that is largely responsible for its success in
the industry. Working for a company that actively maintains such a culture is a necessity for me, since it
would allow for my growth and development both personally and professionally, and Belvedere Trading
excels in this regard. Partaking in this externship will allow me to see the firm’s culture at work, and get a
glimpse of the collaborative team dynamic present across the firm.
Belvedere Trading is a distinct company not only in what it does, but also in how it operates. The
firm’s ability to allow for the growth and success of its employees through various technical roles while
fostering an open team dynamic is one of the many reasons I am excited to participate in Belvedere

         Why do you want to participate in the BASE Program (500 word maximum)
As a child, the first time I heard a plane fly over my head, I looked up, and was fascinated by
what I saw; fast forward fifteen years, and I still look up every time, and am still fascinated. Aviation and
the aerospace industry is something that I am very passionate about, and Boeing is a leader and
innovator in this field. As someone interested in finance however, I was worried I would have to choose
between these passions; Boeing has shown me that this is not the case. I am interested in partaking in
the BASE Program because it provides me the unique opportunities of learning about and working in the
intersection of aerospace and finance. This program will not only allow me to explore my passions in a
professional setting, but it will also aid in my personal development. By collaborating with employees
across Boeing, I will gain insight into Boeing and the aerospace industry, which will prove vital to my
career as I look to pursue an occupation in this field. The BASE Program will also allow me to connect
with individuals across the nation with interests similar to mine, which will allow me to form a network
that will last a lifetime.
On a personal note, as a Latino first-generation college student pursuing a career in the fields of
aerospace and finance, I have often found myself to be the only person of color attending an
information session or networking event in either of these fields. Because of the color of my skin, I have
often been underestimated by peers and recruiters alike through inquiries such as “Are you sure you can
work in such a technical field?” or “You know there is a lot of math involved, right?”. I am interested in
participating in the BASE Program because Boeing celebrates its diversity and utilizes it as a force of
unification rather than that of division. This opportunity will allow me to connect with underrepresented
individuals such as myself and learn from their experiences and viewpoints. Through this program, I will
be able to work with individuals from across the country, each of whom will have a distinct perspective.
Such an environment of collaboration, when coupled with the amazing opportunities offered by Boeing,
will provide me with the insight and growth necessary to catalyze my career in these fields and allow me
to attain a brighter and more prosperous future.
As a child, I always flung paper planes across my room and smiled, knowing that I was the
reason it could seamlessly glide through the air. In the future, every time I hear a plane fly over my head,
I want to be able to look up and smile, knowing that I was a part of the reason it could do the same. This
is why I want to participate in the BASE Program.
           
           While many receive compliments with jubilation, I have grown to accept them with hesitance. Too
often, the qualifying phrase “… for a Latino” follows any praise sent my way. While many may consider
my ethnicity a disadvantage, I have grown to view it as an invaluable asset. My background and
experiences allow me to bring a diverse perspective to the table, and I hope to be able to do this at D.E.
Shaw. The firm is not only one of the most influential forces on Wall Street, but also prides itself in its
ability to leverage the diversity of its employees, a value I admire. D.E. Shaw’s Quantitative Strategies
group is at the forefront of the intersection of finance and technology, and I hope to contribute my
expertise in machine learning and advanced statistical modelling while learning from experts from both
this group and across the firm.
